# Padding Oracle Attack (Applied Cryptography project)
Supervised by Prof. Ahmad Alsadeh.

This project investigates the vulnerabilities of cryptographic padding, focusing on the Padding Oracle Attack. Using Docker for simulation, we explored how incorrect padding implementation can expose data to unauthorized decryption. By performing this attack manually and automatically, we demonstrated the risks associated with padding in block cipher encryption. The study stresses the importance of secure encryption methods to prevent such vulnerabilities and protect data privacy
